## External resources

**Care about your code**

....and those who write it

* [Make your code citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
* [Hidden REF](https://hidden-ref.org/) - There's more to research than papers but the UK's official measure, The Research Excellence Framework (REF), doesn't reflect this.  The Hidden REF aims to change that! 
* [Research Software Engineers Associaton](https://rse.ac.uk/) - Supporting the people behind research software
* [The Turing Way](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-handbook-reproducible-data-science) - Guidelines on reproducible research from the Alan Turing Institute

**Academic Papers on reproducible research and software quality**

* [The (black) art of runtime evaluation: Are we comparing algorithms or implementations?](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-016-1004-2) - Demonstrating that the difference between the best and worst implementations of ML algorithms can be more than **10,000 times**. Even when only considering mature frameworks

## Version Control - Learn git

* [Download and install git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - GitLab. If you need to host your own in-house replacement for GitHub.
* [Oh Shit! Git](https://ohshitgit.com/) - Hardly anyone knows how to use all of git.  What we do is use the same few commands and google our way out of trouble when things go wrong.  This site covers many cases that you'll run into in practice

## Distribute your computational environment, not just the code

* [My Conda cheatsheet](./conda.md) - Conda: One way to do it in Python
* [The MRAN](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2019/05/cran-snapshots-and-you.html) - Daily snapshots of the R CRAN repository to allow you to version by date
